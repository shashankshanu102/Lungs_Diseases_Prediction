# Classification of Lungs Diseases using Deep Learning techniques

# Problem Statement:

To classify chest X-rays images to detect pneumonia using deep learning techniques and furthermore to distinguish viral and bacterial pneumonia to facilitate rapid referrals for children needing urgent intervention.

# Introduction

Pneumonia accounts for over 15% of all deaths of children under 5 years old internationally. In 2015, 920,000 children under the age of 5 died from the disease. In the United States, pneumonia accounts for over 500,000 visits to emergency departments and over 50,000 deaths in 2015, keeping the ailment on the list of top 10 causes of death in the country.
While common, accurately diagnosing pneumonia is a tall order. It requires review of a chest radiograph (CXR) by highly trained specialists and confirmation through clinical history, vital signs and laboratory exams. Pneumonia usually manifests as an area or areas of increased opacity on CXR. However, the diagnosis of pneumonia on CXR is complicated because of a number of other conditions in the lungs such as fluid overload (pulmonary edema), bleeding, volume loss (atelectasis or collapse), lung cancer, or post-radiation or surgical changes. Outside of the lungs, fluid in the pleural space (pleural effusion) also appears as increased opacity on CXR. When available, comparison of CXRs of the patient taken at different time points and correlation with clinical symptoms and history are helpful in making the diagnosis.
CXRs are the most commonly performed diagnostic imaging study. A number of factors such as positioning of the patient and depth of inspiration can alter the appearance of the CXR, complicating interpretation further. In addition, clinicians are faced with reading high volumes of images every shift.

# Data Description

The dataset is organized into 3 folders (train, test, val) and contains subfolders for each image category (Pneumonia/Normal). There are 5,863 X-Ray images (JPEG) and 2 categories (Pneumonia/Normal).
Chest X-ray images (anterior-posterior) were selected from retrospective cohorts of pediatric patients of one to five years old from Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Center, Guangzhou. All chest X-ray imaging was performed as part of patients’ routine clinical care.
For the analysis of chest x-ray images, all chest radiographs were initially screened for quality control by removing all low quality or unreadable scans. The diagnoses for the images were then graded by two expert physicians before being cleared for training the AI system. In order to account for any grading errors, the evaluation set was also checked by a third expert.
